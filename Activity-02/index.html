    <h3>If you were a boat, what type would you be?
    <p>If I were a boat, I would be a sailboat. Sailboats are guided by both wind and skill, adapting gracefully to ever-changing conditions. I value flexibility, calm determination, and the ability to navigate life's waters with patience and direction â€” just like a sailboat cruising through the ocean with quiet strength.</p>
