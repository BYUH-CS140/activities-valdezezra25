        <p>
            Pinakbet- Ilocanos take pride in their version of this vegetable stew.
            It typically includes bitter gourd (ampalaya), eggplant, okra, string beans, tomatoes, and traditionally
            flavored with bagoong isda (fermented fish paste). Some versions may include pork or shrimp. Notably, the
            Ilocano version often omits squash.

        <p>
            Batac Empanada: Originating from Batac City in Ilocos Norte, this empanada has a distinct bright orange
            color in its rice flour dough,
            thanks to the use of annatto seeds. It's typically filled with green papaya, mung beans, chopped Ilocano
            longganisa (sausage), and a hard-boiled egg, then deep-fried to a crispy finish.
